Python Project Ideas
--------------------

1. Rational class

	- Create a class Rational that can represent rational numbers (of the form p/q). 
	- Define the appropriate constructors and override __repr__ and __unicode__
	- It should have the methods add/subtract/multiply/divide with parameters (self, other).
	- Each method takes in another Rational object and returns a *new* Rational object representing the result.
	- Every return value should be a simplified fraction. 
	
	Hint:
	- look into classes
	- look at Euclid's gcd algorithm

2. Write a simple game using pygame

	- write a Snake application
	- use arrow keys to move left, up, down, right
	- game logic should be backed by a 2D grid
	- snake should move x cells every y seconds
	- each square of the snake's body should move to the square before it
	- color the head something different
	- extra credit:
		- game over screen
		- select screen
		- score
		- different backgrounds

	Hints:
	- pygame framework
	- read about event loops and processing
	- learn about finite state machines
	- get good at writing classes and writing modular code


3. Write a simple chat application

	- Single client/server
	- Start the server, then start the client (these should be separate processes run from the shell)
	- Client sends a single string to the server
	- Server will echo the entire history after each client request

	Hints:
	- look into Python's sockets API
	- look into Python's os and multiprocessing packages
	- learn about IP addresses (use the loopback address)
	- use Google
